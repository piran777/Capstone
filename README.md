Urban traffic congestion is a growing concern, leading to increased travel times, fuel
consumption, and pollution. This project aims to develop an innovative traffic management
system that utilizes heat maps to visualize traffic density at specific intersections. The system
will employ image processing techniques using YOLO and data analytics to create heat maps
from pictures or traffic data with the pandas library from Python, providing a visual
representation of traffic density and identifying congestion hotspots. The effectiveness of the
heat map-based traffic management system will be evaluated through simulations and real-world
tests. The project is expected to demonstrate the potential of heat maps and machine learning as
tools for improving traffic management, leading to more efficient and responsive traffic control
systems. Future directions for enhancing the system and lessons learned from the project will
provide valuable insights for further research in the field of traffic management. Our project is
aimed at creating a backbone for even larger systems that will eventually require this tool. In a
real world environment the tool is aimed to be embedded into real traffic intersections where
images can be taken of each intersection for more effective data usage and implementation of the
tool.
